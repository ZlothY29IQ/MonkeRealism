I just want to explain the current situation going on. Basically the other day I noticed that Graze was working on a body tracking mod. Which reminded me that I had an old project similar to this (I dont wanna drag anyone into this but some of my friends may remember me testing it a while back in a modded and my body was just spazzing out). The reason I never completed or published it was because I didnt have body trackers back then, therefore I had to use AI camera trackers, but I was planning on buying some slimes for VrChat,Blade and Sourcery, Beat Saber & MoCap. So I decided to wait until I got my trackers. By the time I got them I had forgot about that project and was working on some other stuff. So when I saw graze's TikTok video it reminded me that I had this half finished project and decided to wrap it up now that I had trackers. I spent probably 8 hours straight working on it and fine tweaking it which I know lots of people may not be able to do because of personal reasons or they have a job. Without even thinking I stupidly decided to just straight up publish it once I was happy enough with it. I dont know if it was me wanting to be recognised in this community or something else but I now see I made a huge mistake. If Graze wants to work with me to make a really good mod together im more than happy to but they already said "Just dont worry about it, Stopping my version was my decision". Even though theyre being nice I know that they dont really like me which is 100% reasonable.
I know that saying this does not make up for my actions and im not planning it does I just want to explain the situation for some people that may not know and once again, im deeply sorry Graze. I should've taken it into more consideration instead of blindly publishing it, especially before you published it yourself officially.
