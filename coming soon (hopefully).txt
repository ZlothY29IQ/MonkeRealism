Im gonna add legs and allow actual full body. Gonna attempt to network the legs and make a mod that just networks the legs full body so people who dont have a way/want to use full body can see others full body. Proper calibration method using poses and motion. Original plan for this mod was to not only just add full body but try and make this mod make the game as realistic as possiible. So after legs ill attempt some form of realistic graphics (realistic textures, Reshade, GCorp Lighting, exc.), add visual and sounds effects for falling, running, climbing. Add stamina. Legit gonna make this real life frfr. I woulnt mind if anyone *kinda known* and knows what they're doings wants to contribute.

Probably wont get started on this for a while however as im currently working on my GorillaCinema mod and im not even at my computer for a few days. Can still work on this tho if I need to or someone offers to colab, from my laptop.
